      "Marriage comes with a lot of unavoidable expenses in India and spending a big chunk of your savings on furniture and white goods could be a big challenge. RentoMojo not just took away all our worries but in fact went to the extent of spoiling us. Where I could have owned just some bare essentials after making a huge hole in my pocket or paid unnecessary EMIs, I could smartly own a lot of stuff which would have come much later on my list. Heartfelt thanks to  the whole Rentomojo team for making our renting experience completely hassle free It has been two great years and I am sure there are many more to come",
